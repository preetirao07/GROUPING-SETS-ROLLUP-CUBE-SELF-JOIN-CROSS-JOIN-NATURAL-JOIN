# GROUPING-SETS-ROLLUP-CUBE-SELF-JOIN-CROSS-JOIN-NATURAL-JOIN
This repository contains my personal SQL practice file where I learned and explored advanced SQL aggregation techniques using the PostgreSQL

The goal of this project is to build mastery in:
1. GROUPING SETS
2. ROLLUP
3. CUBE
4. Window functions
5. Self Joins
6. Hierarchical queries
7. Cross Join
8. Natural Join

This file includes step-by-step examples, real-world challenges, and complex queries that simulate business analytics tasks.
